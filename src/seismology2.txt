<h4>Scholte wave interferometry and source localization</h4>

In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1190/tle40080576.1">a study published in <i>The Leading Edge</i> in 2021</a>, we revisited the North Sea dataset and focused on the value of passive ocean-bottom DAS surveys for offshore engineering and hazard analysis. Applying seismic interferometry to only one hour of data, we obtained a shallow shear-wave velocity model along the cable path, demonstrating a non-invasive alternative for site characterization in coastal regions where cable networks are already present. We also isolated spurious arrivals arising from structural vibrations of individual wind turbines nearby, suggesting potential for remote operational and structural health monitoring.
