<p>I recently completed my Ph.D. in geophysics at the Caltech Seismo Lab, working with Prof. Zhongwen Zhan. In January 2023, I am moving to the University of Washington as a postdoctoral scholar. I apply fiber optic sensing to problems in engineering/environmental seismology and physical oceanography.</p>
